Learning latent visual features from images using CNNs and Autoencoders

Overview

This project explores learning latent visual representations from images using convolutional autoencoders and CNNs. The workflow mimics scientific pipelines where image structure is correlated with physical properties.

Methods

Image preprocessing and normalization

Transfer learning CNN baseline

Convolutional autoencoder feature extraction

PCA visualization of latent space

Key Insight

The autoencoder compresses images into a feature vector representing structural patterns (texture density, repetition, clustering). Similar images cluster together, demonstrating how visual morphology can map to measurable behaviour in materials.

Relevance

This workflow mirrors approaches used in material science and pharmaceutical research, where image morphology predicts bulk material properties.
